Play! Framework Slow Pages Module
by Felipe Oliveira

1) Configuration (application.conf)

slowpages.max=0
slowpages.enabled=true

It tracks the execution time, if it happens to be greater than the value defines on slowpages.max it logs a warning.
You can disable it by using the property key slowpages.enabled.

If you define slowpages.max=0 it will log on every request.

You can add your own listener by calling SlowPagesPlugin.addListener().
